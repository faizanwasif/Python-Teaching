    "# Defining Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a Python function called \"say_hello\" that prints \"Hello, world!\" when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a function named \"print_numbers\" that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write a function \"greet_user\" that prints a welcoming message like \"Welcome to Python!\" \n",
    "    when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a function \"print_hello_twice\" that prints \"Hello\" two times when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a function called \"print_greeting\" that prints \"Hi there!\" when called.\n",

    "# Multiple Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a Python function called \"calculate_rectangle_area\" that takes two parameters, \n",
    "    length and width, and returns the area of a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a function \"calculate_product\" that takes two parameters, num1 and num2, \n",
    "    and returns the product of these two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write a function \"create_full_name\" that takes two parameters, first_name and last_name, \n",
    "    and returns the full name as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a function named \"calculate_sum\" that takes multiple arguments \n",
    "    and returns the sum of all the arguments provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a function \"find_largest\" that takes multiple arguments (numbers) \n",
    "    and returns the largest number among them.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Return Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a Python function named \"multiply\" that takes two numbers as arguments and \n",
    "    returns their product.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write a function called \"get_average\" that takes three numbers as arguments and \n",
    "    returns their average.\n",

    "# Scope of Variables in Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a Python function called \"calculate_area\" that takes the base \n",
    "    and height as parameters and calculates the area of a triangle using \n",
    "    the formula area = 0.5 * base * height. Ensure that \"area\" is a local variable within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a function \"count_vowels\" that takes a string as a parameter \n",
    "    and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input string. \n",
    "    Use a local variable \"vowel_count\" to store the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write a function \"calculate_discounted_price\" that takes the original price \n",
    "    and a discount rate as parameters. Calculate the final price after applying \n",
    "    the discount and store it in a local variable \"discounted_price.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a Python program with a global variable \"total_sales\" set to 0. \n",
    "    Define a function \"update_sales\" that takes a sale amount as a parameter \n",
    "    and adds it to the global \"total_sales.\" Call this function multiple \n",
    "    times with different sale amounts and print the final \"total_sales\" value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a global variable \"current_user\" with an initial value of \"Guest.\" \n",
    "    Write a function \"set_user\" that takes a username as a parameter \n",
    "    and sets the global variable \"current_user\" to the provided username. \n",
    "    Call the function with different usernames to change the current user.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a Python program with a global variable \"counter\" set to 0. \n",
    "    Define a function \"increment_counter\" that increments the global \"counter\" by 1. \n",
    "    Call this function multiple times and print the final \"counter\" value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reusing Code with Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write a Python function called \"find_minimum\" that \n",
    "    takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the minimum value in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a function \"is_even\" that takes a number as an \n",
    "    argument and returns True if the number is even and False if it's not."
